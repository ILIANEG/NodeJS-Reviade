# NodeJS-Reviade

Project is in progress.

- Recreation of my old project Reviade in NodeJS with ExpressJs framework
- This time I have followed MVC pattern (model view controller separated)
- I am working to implement this web application with RESTful API in mind, there are still couple changes that has to be done to consistantly adhere to this architecture (namely my ownerController still renders template in respond to request, while should send json data)
